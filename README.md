## ‚öôÔ∏è Process
1. **Data Collection:**  
   - Imported NYC Airbnb listing dataset from Kaggle using the Kaggle API.  
   - Ensured data completeness and accuracy.

2. **Data Preprocessing:**  
   - Handled missing values and removed outliers.  
   - Encoded categorical features (e.g., neighborhood, room type).  

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**  
   - Visualized price variations across neighborhoods and room types.  
   - Analyzed the relationship between reviews, availability, and price.  

4. **Model Training:**  
   - Applied **Linear Regression** and **XGBoost** models.  
   - Split data into training and testing sets (80:20 ratio).  

5. **Model Evaluation:**  
   - Compared models using **MAE**, **RMSE**, and **R¬≤ Score**.  
   - Identified key features influencing Airbnb prices.
